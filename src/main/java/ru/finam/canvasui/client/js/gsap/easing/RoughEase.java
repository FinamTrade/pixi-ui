/**
 * Created by ikusch on 27.08.14.
 *
 * Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values,
 * but RoughEase provides an easy way to get a rough, jagged effect instead, or you can also
 * get an evenly-spaced back-and-forth movement if you prefer. Configure the RoughEase by passing
 * an object to the constructor or config() method with any of the following properties (all are optional)
 *
 * clamp : Boolean - setting clamp to true will prevent points from exceeding the end
 *  value or dropping below the starting value. For example, if you're tweening the x property
 *  from 0 to 100, the RoughEase would force all random points to stay between 0 and 100 if
 *  clamp is true, but if it is false, x could potentially jump above 100 or below 0 at some point during the
 *  tween (it would always end at 100 though in this example) (Default: false).
 *
 * points : Number - the number of points to be plotted along the ease, making it jerk more or less frequently. (Default: 20)
 *
 * randomize : Boolean - by default, the placement of points will be randomized (creating the roughness)
 *  but you can set randomize to false to make the points zig-zag evenly across the ease. Using this in
 *  conjunction with a taper value can create a nice effect. (Default: true)
 *
 * strength : Number - controls how far from the template ease the points are allowed to wander (a small
 *  number like 0.1 keeps it very close to the template ease whereas a larger number like 5 creates much
 *  bigger variations). (Default: 1)
 *
 * taper : String - ("in" | "out" | "both" | "none") - to make the strength of the roughness taper towards
 *  the end or beginning or both, use "out", "in", or "both" respectively. (Default: "none")
 *
 * template : Ease - an ease that should be used as a template, like a general guide. The RoughEase will
 *  plot points that wander from that template. You can use this to influence the general shape of the
 *  RoughEase. (Default: Linear.easeNone)
