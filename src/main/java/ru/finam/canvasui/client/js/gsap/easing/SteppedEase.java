/**
 * Created by ikusch on 27.08.14.
 *
 * Most easing equations give a smooth, gradual transition between the start and end values,
 * but SteppedEase provides an easy way to define a specific number of steps that the transition
 * should take. For example, if mc.x is 0 and you want to tween it to 100 with 5
 * steps (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100) over the course of 2 seconds, you'd do:
 *
 *  TweenLite.to(mc, 2, {x:100, ease:SteppedEase.config(5)});
 *  //or create an instance directly
 *  var steppedEase = new SteppedEase(5);
 *  TweenLite.to(mc, 3, {y:300, ease:steppedEase});
 *
 * Note: SteppedEase is optimized for use with the GreenSock tweenining platform, so it isn't
 * intended to be used with other engines. Specifically, its easing equation always
 * returns values between 0 and 1.
 *
