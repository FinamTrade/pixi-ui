/**
 * Created by ikusch on 27.08.14.
 *
 * Provides an easeIn, easeOut, and easeInOut with a power (or strength) of 4 which is identical
 * to Quint and Strong but with a more intuitive name. The more power, the more exaggerated the
 * easing effect. Using a numeric approach like this in the name makes experimenting easier.
 * This is one of the eases that is natively accelerated in TweenLite and TweenMax. All of the
 * "Power" eases and their counterparts (Linear (0), Quad (1), Cubic (2), Quart (3),
 * Quint (4), and Strong (4)) are accelerated.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * TweenLite.to(obj, 1, {x:100, ease:Power4.easeOut});
 *
